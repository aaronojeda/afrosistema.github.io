user_description: Self-motivated, analytical and creative software engineer. One way or another, I have been linked to video games professionally, personally or academically during my whole life. Needless to say, I love them. My thesis was about 2D platformers development with C++ and SDL. Leaving aside video games, I have experience in data science and a strong knowledge on basketball.

# Project descriptions
project_AG: American Girl World is a game by American Girl Publishing Inc. It is a visual novel taking place in the world of American Girl, the popular line of dolls of Mattel.
project_HempInc: Part of the team that developed American Girl World and Hemp Inc, two commercial mobile games for Android and iOS.
project_S2PEditor: Game engine and GUI for the development of 2D platform games in Windows. Built using C++, SDL and Qt.
project_ThinkB4: My first Ludum Dare entry is a micro-platformer where jumping costs power. It has four levels and four different endings. I didn’t have enough time to design the levels properly so the game is extremely easy. Actually it’s more an idea than a game, but this is what LD is about, right?
project_Epione: Cofounder of e-pione, startup with the aim of finding e-Health solutions for the diagnosis of neurological diseases, specially Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.
