user_description: Self-motivated, analytical and creative software engineer. One way or another, I have been linked to video games professionally, personally or academically during my whole life. Needless to say, I love them. My thesis was about 2D platformers development with C++ and SDL. Leaving aside video games, I have experience in data science and a strong knowledge on basketball.
